        The hypothesis is that b/c the tasks are
        updated by a different write TX, there is a

        installs to be created and then expected for
        the task to have already been marked as
        successful.

                                        Return big integer values as strings
                                        instead of bigint as we need to

                                        parse them back into strings anyway when
                                        returning data from pine. The

                                        new logic and types closely follow the
                                        same pattern we have for dates.

                                                The internal and external
                                                representation of the returned
                                                object from pinejs should be
                                                consistent.

                                                Pinejs internal interface will
                                                return date or date time fields
                                                as date object. For the external
                                                interface the object is
                                                JSON.stringified so that date
                                                becomes an ISO string anyway.

                                        Return big integer values as strings
                                        instead of bigint as we need to

                                        parse them back into strings anyway when
                                        returning data from pine. The

                                        new logic and types closely follow the
                                        same pattern we have for dates.

                                parse them back into strings anyway when
                                returning data from pine. The

                                new logic and types closely follow the same
                                pattern we have for dates.

                                        The internal and external representation
                                        of the returned object from pinejs
                                        should be consistent.

                                        Pinejs internal interface will return
                                        date or date time fields as date object.
                                        For the external interface the object is
                                        JSON.stringified so that date becomes an
                                        ISO string anyway.

                                        available whilst also avoiding
                                        accidental breaking changes

                                                The internal and external
                                                representation of the returned
                                                object from pinejs should be
                                                consistent.

                                                Pinejs internal interface will
                                                return date or date time fields
                                                as date object. For the external
                                                interface the object is
                                                JSON.stringified so that date
                                                becomes an ISO string anyway.

                                        The internal and external representation
                                        of the returned object from pinejs
                                        should be consistent.

                                        Pinejs internal interface will return
                                        date or date time fields as date object.
                                        For the external interface the object is
                                        JSON.stringified so that date becomes an
                                        ISO string anyway.

                This should give the same result whenever the resource name has
                a

                version suffix, however in the case it is unversioned then it
                should be

                more correct as that will be the table it gets translated to for
                the

                next version

          * `application.is_dependent_on_by__application`

        Changes:

        * the `user.actor`, `device.actor`, `application.actor` to return a

        * the `device.overall_status`'s
          * `offline` to `disconnected`

            * `operational` when the device is heartbeating, and is either connected to cloudlink or has the vpn configured to be off
            * `reduced-functionality` when the device has only a heartbeat or is only connected to cloudlink

        Replaces:

        * `device.should_be_running__release` with
        `device.is_pinned_on__release`

        Follow-up of #1708.
        Before #1708 we were using 'Table' directly,
        so switching to 'Resource' added more
        permissions checks to the query, which also
        unintentionally broke device requests from
        actors don't have permissions to access the
        image_installs.

                        This requires passing the model typings when creating
                        the pinejs-client

                        instance and will mean that any usage after that will be
                        type checked

                        to limit to resources/properties that exist on the
                        model. This covers

                        almost all usage but there are some cases we cannot
                        cover as we would

                        need typescript support for partial inference of
                        generics, eg for

                        lambdas, or to make major changes to the querying
                        interface.

                        This work should also be fully backwards compatible such
                        that if you do

                        not provide model typings then all typings should
                        continue to work as

                        previously

                        The intention is that these are use as helpers functions
                        to build the

                        url from an object and so passing a `url` directly is
                        not really the

                        intent and interferes with improving the typings for the
                        intended case.

                        It is still possible to pass urls directly to the
                        `request` function if

                        it is essential but the true answer is to support
                        building those urls,

                        and using `prepare` if it is necessary

                        This is because they are not designed to support using a

                        likely to break in very weird and unexpected ways, and
                        as such removing

                        it from the typing should reduce potential for

                        This requires passing the model typings when creating
                        the pinejs-client

                        instance and will mean that any usage after that will be
                        type checked

                        to limit to resources/properties that exist on the
                        model. This covers

                        almost all usage but there are some cases we cannot
                        cover as we would

                        need typescript support for partial inference of
                        generics, eg for

                        lambdas, or to make major changes to the querying
                        interface.

                        This work should also be fully backwards compatible such
                        that if you do

                        not provide model typings then all typings should
                        continue to work as

                        previously

                        The intention is that these are use as helpers functions
                        to build the

                        url from an object and so passing a `url` directly is
                        not really the

                        intent and interferes with improving the typings for the
                        intended case.

                        It is still possible to pass urls directly to the
                        `request` function if

                        it is essential but the true answer is to support
                        building those urls,

                        and using `prepare` if it is necessary

                        This is because they are not designed to support using a
                        `url` and are

                        likely to break in very weird and unexpected ways, and
                        as such removing

                        it from the typing should reduce potential for
                        surprising errors

        This is necessary because when creating migration on pine generated
        resources (user)

        when starting on a clean database migrations won't run and pine will
        create a user table

        using its default model, this ensures a clean DB will also contain the
        len constraint

      body: >
        user (Auth) email is a nullable property. However, instead of using the
        actual null current

        API behaviour forces it to be an empty string. This is problematic as
        ideally the email field

        would have a unique constraint to it (and NULL value is considered
        distinct by default,

        different than empty string)

                        This allows easily choosing read vs write types with
                        just one set of

                        types with no need to generate/manage two separate sets
                        of typings. It

                        also allows these typings to be passed as generics to
                        other functions

                        and they will also be able to distinguish read vs write

        On the environments I tested,

        pg_stat_all_indexes shows the longer index

        being used at least 2000x more often, and

        surprisingly enough being slightly smaller as well, which I guess might
        mean that the old

        index has bloat.

        This commit relocates the test cases for the device additions from
        balena-api to open-balena-api. The move consolidates the tests with
        their corresponding implementation, enhancing maintainability and
        coherence in project structure.

      body: >
        Fix usage of `DateString` to actually as DateString and not as a `Date`


        This is a major change as the exported internal API reference from
        `open-balena-api` when used as module breaks the type interface.

        The model types have always been generated as `string` but actually
        returned as `Date`.

                Debian Buster now uses Avahi 0.7 instead of
                0.6.32. This means that there is now a stricter
                policy defining MDNS domains. This commit allows
                us to use multipart subdomains.

                Should subdomain variables not be set for a component, this
                base change attempts to set relevant subdomain envvars to
                the current resin device UUID, assuming a base `BALENA_TLD`
                envvar is present.

                Historically, aliasing of containers occured via the use
                of the `--link` (or `links` property of `docker-compose`).
                This would be required on each container to ensure that
                the relevant alias would be added to the `/etc/hosts` file.
                However, this functionality is now deprecated in favour
                of the use of the `networks.<name>.aliases` property, set
                on a particular service to ensure all other services can
                reach that service using the bridge on which they exist.
                Unfortunately, this is carried out by adding the records
                to the Docker daemon's internal DNS, referenced before
                propagating to the host. Whilst this is good in theory,
                in the case where MDNS is used (and in particular the
                recommended Avahi `libnss-mdns` NS switch config) this
                means that MDNS is consulted *before* the Docker DNS
                service, in effect meaning that aliases to the internal
                IP address for a service are never used, and in effect
                negating them.
                To counter this, this commit ensures that DNS is
                *always* prioritised over MDNS. This has the effect of
                querying DNS for `.local` addresses, which can lead
                to an initial lag in lookups (although these should then
                be cached locally per service), and potentially more DNS
                traffic that ideal. However, for the purposes of a
                Devenv/OnPrem, this is acceptable.
                It has no effect on Cloud deployed instances, as they
                will not use `.local` suffixes.

                rowCount can be NULL in the case of PG returning from `LOCK`


                Refernece:

                https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/66990

                https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/pull/2967


                In pinejs the case is handled and as of now we don't want to
                populate a breaking change by transparently push the types to
                callers.

              body: >
                On empty database schemas the `migrations` model is not
                executed.

                Hence, every model migration that is executed before the
                `migrations` model

                will not be tracked properly. This is an edge case for empty
                database schemas.

      hash: e70930dbb2146c9f50ca635f38a7223e0b042fe9
      body: |
        Enables row narrowing when the rule is
        triggered by application changes, but more
        importantly allows bC to rewrite the rule using
        a GROUP BY.
        Also reduces slightly the full rule runtime from
        ~200ms to ~180ms.

      hash: bb78ee588d5d899607ee5ea7e3e3ab00942127ec
      body: |
        Currently that rule does a full table scan and
        needs 2s, so adding a partial index on the
        deprecated release_version, fields should
        greatly improve its performance, while having
        small DB size & index maintenance work load.

      hash: 98c21ac4c2dc42a32ab34669139147b04442f2d0
      body: |
        PR #1199 relaxed the allowed character set for configuration variables,
        but it also inadvertently relaxed the `/config/vars` JSON schema
        exported by the API. This would cause that the UI allows the extended
        character set for env vars, but the API would ultimately reject it,
        creating an inconsistency. This PR adds a `configVarInvalidRegex`
        variable to the schema that should be adopted by the UI to render
        configuration variables.

                        This increases the minimum postgres version for
                        AggregateJSON from 9.2

                        to 9.3 but it is likely that other places already
                        require postgres

                        >=9.3 and as such this should not increase the minimum
                        version at all.

                        If it does somehow manage to then increasing the minimum
                        from a 2012

                        postgres to 2013 should still be fine

      hash: 7dd4f5e2a1e528a2e60d6b4707825aec06267325
      body: |
        While the state endpoint allows patching the device name since v2, that
        feature hasn't really been used by supervisor until supervisor v13 when
        that feature was introduced by mistake. Because of a race condition
        between supervisors v13.0.0 and v14.0.2, the device name may get either
        an empty value or the value 'local', this can cause confusion in users
        or affect the user workflows that depend on having distinct device
        names.

        This commit removes the device name from the list of allowed patch
        variables for the v3 state endpoint.

      body: |
        Atm is_host eq 1 or is_public eq 1 ===
        is_public eq 1, so the is_host check is
        redundant. It seem that the is_host eq 1 is a
        leftover since before we added is_public and
        adopted its semantics in host apps.

                                add/sub are supported for date values.

                                DateArithmetic nodes need input dependent

    - subject: Prevent unauthenticated requests from proceeding in token auth
      hash: 3e104e34c111f06b9e1bb3de2c64e28678d9c1d9
      body: >
        Authentication failure due to "no credentials provided" and due to
        "invalid credentials provided" are currently treated in exactly the same
        way: we just let the request proceed and rely on (no) permissions to
        limit access to resources. This is problematic (it can result in
        redundant work being done in the API) and misleading ("I've provided
        creds but I get back no results").


        This change separates the latter case and responds immediately with 401,
        as it should.


        This is however a workaround and ideally it would be Pine that makes
        this distinction and throws an exception appropriately but this would be
        a breaking change to existing code.

                Eg. migrations need to know if a model is freshly generated /
                executed

                of if this model already existed and can be target for
                migrations.

                This changes the bypass to only occur before guest permissions
                are

                initialized, only when specifically using `root` or `rootRead`

                permissions, and also now constrains the model to the specific

                permissions passed in rather than bypassing permissions
                altogether

                for the root cases

                                        Property type describes if the reference
                                        is 'strict' or 'informative'.


                                        Behaviour change only if type is
                                        informative otherwise default 'strict'.


                                        An informative reference is just an int
                                        field that points

                                        to another tables id field - like
                                        foreign key without constraints

                                        or foregein key cascades.

                                Property type describes if the reference is
                                'strict' or 'informative'.


                                Behaviour change only if type is informative
                                otherwise default 'strict'.


                                An informative reference is just an int field
                                that points

                                to another tables id field - like foreign key
                                without constraints

                                or foregein key cascades.

                        Property type describes if the reference is 'strict' or
                        'informative'.


                        Behaviour change only if type is informative otherwise
                        default 'strict'.


                        An informative reference is just an int field that
                        points

                        to another tables id field - like foreign key without
                        constraints

                        or foregein key cascades.

                                        to another tables id field - like
                                        foreign key without constraints

                                        or foregein key cascades.

                                Behaviour change only if type is informative
                                otherwise default 'strict'.


                                An informative reference is just an int field
                                that points

                                to another tables id field - like foreign key

                                or foregein key cascades.

    - subject: Only publish logs to redis subscribers if there are any
      hash: 00393277e4a0b618101e41d61ced675a72c64288
      body: |
        The idea of this is that if we can avoid issuing the PUBLISH calls for
        logs when there are no active subscribers then we can save a lot of
        work for redis, particularly when there are many nodes. The problem is
        that there's no (safe) way to get the number of current subscribers,
        you can query for current subscribers but it'll only return subscribers
        that are connected to the current node and as it is possible to
        subscribe to any node that means that no subscribers on the current
        node is not the same as no subscribers. The solution used here is to
        increment a subscribers count key when a given API instance first
        subscribes to a given device's logs and then decrement it when
        unsubscribing. The problem with that is that if we experience a
        crash/redeploy/etc the subscribers count could end up being permanently
        > 0, we handle that here by adding an expiry time when incrementing the
        subscribers count and using a heartbeat whilst the subscription is
        active to ensure that the subscribers count does not expire whilst we
        have an actively subscribed instance but it will expire if the instance
        that incremented it disappears for whatever reason. This does mean that
        if we get regular connects/disconnects for certain logs then it means
        the subscriber count for that log would never expire but the
        expectation is that should be rare enough that the small extra load
        from that is minimal and still better than having no subscriber count
        mechanism.

        For the intial release we are not supporting applications with multiple
        services as the intended use is blocks.

        These changes will reject requests with a value for service following
        the commit|semver.

        It will also reject images at the DB query if the release has multiple
        release images.

        Revert this commit to restore support for multiple services.

      body: |
        This assumes that all clients that can access
        an image, also have access to the application
        it belongs to. The speed gains for device
        authorizations are b/c of how canAccess()
        permissions are applied & how PG is able to
        run the complex application read permission
        on the top level of the query rather than when
        nested 4 into level of `EXISTS (SELECT 1)`.

        It seems that atm it's not needed & on top of
        that, the "edge" has been discontinued for
        some time now. Other than that and
        returning just the slug, the
        `normalizeDeviceType` was literally the
        same as `findBySlug`.

      hash: 9e688feacdeb95567f92bba54c9479e098e01a58
      body: |
        The cloud API has a rule which enforces this
        restriction, which means that a PATCH of a device's
        supervisor_version could fail if this code returned
        a release of a different public app that has the same
        release_version.

                host-envvars handling

                * add systemd path watcher to restart confd if keys/certs change
                during runtime

                * store stack configuration available to all services in a
                persistent/shared volume (/balena)

                * change resolver order to dns => mdns (ipv4) => mdns (ipv6) =>
                return

                * configure API key and JOSE/JWT key id

                * configure API keys/tokens

                * configure proxy and devices SSH keys

                        type

        We already enforce this in the hook itself, and this rule prevents
        devices that have provisioned with an invalidated hostapp release from
        ever PATCHing/updating after the fact. we ideally only want to enforce
        this rule at upgrade time, rather than always

        This reverts commit db990479be2611f24b6262e12e1dfa092473cea0.

        OpenBalena is not the place to do the config vars change for the private
        device types such as the UniPi Neuron so we revert this commit here.

        This will reduce the load for the common case where active devices are
        not regularly deleted with the potential to briefly respond with a 401
        when a device is first deleted. There may also be a slight delay for
        restored devices to be able to communicate again however again that is
        a very rare case.

        the "should track latest release" implementation as it no longer needs
        to care about creating service installs itself

      hash: 8041b9696a6b91bc9ef76e8f19c870c8a139f00e
      body: |
        This now requires boolean config vars must be `true` or `false`, or
        not set if they're optional, previously we compared against just `true`
        so any other values would be treated as `false` which could be
        confusing in the case of eg `1`/`on`

      hash: 9c8ad00d99b239d258dcea7130dba5dee9e60b7b
      body: |
        Currently if the API fails to fetch the device types,
        it would retry infinitely, making the dashboard fail
        to load in BoB if there are no device types in S3, and
        this should resolve that.

                host-envvars handling

                * add systemd path watcher to restart confd if keys/certs change
                during runtime

                * store stack configuration available to all services in a
                persistent/shared volume (/balena)

                * change resolver order to dns => mdns (ipv4) => mdns (ipv6) =>
                return

                * configure API key and JOSE/JWT key id

        We already enforce this in the hook itself, and this rule prevents
        devices that have provisioned with an invalidated hostapp release from
        ever PATCHing/updating after the fact. we ideally only want to enforce
        this rule at upgrade time, rather than always

        This reverts commit db990479be2611f24b6262e12e1dfa092473cea0.

        OpenBalena is not the place to do the config vars change for the private
        device types such as the UniPi Neuron so we revert this commit here.

        This will reduce the load for the common case where active devices are
        not regularly deleted with the potential to briefly respond with a 401
        when a device is first deleted. There may also be a slight delay for
        restored devices to be able to communicate again however again that is
        a very rare case.

      body: |
        This avoids issues where you pin an application to a release for which
        some devices are missing service installs. It also allows simplifying
        the "should track latest release" implementation as it no longer needs
        to care about creating service installs itself

        so any other values would be treated as `false` which could be

      hash: 9c8ad00d99b239d258dcea7130dba5dee9e60b7b
      body: |
        Currently if the API fails to fetch the device types,
        it would retry infinitely, making the dashboard fail
        to load in BoB if there are no device types in S3, and
        this should resolve that.

        Application name was used as part of the image name deployed to devices,
        which meant it had to be compatible with Docker’s name requirements.
        We’ve long moved away from that naming scheme so the limit is now
        superfluous and this patch effectively removes it.

                        This allows consumers like pinejs-client-supertest

                        types based solely on the implementation of the
                        request() method.

      hash: 4bed618edad4d2376ac5cecf1f61887e2546fca3
      body: |
        In order to get closer to formally requiring a target supervisor
        release in the model, we should expand our provisioning process to
        provide the initial supervisor_version metadata. This connects back to
        tri-app. Since this requires meta-balena changes as well, we need to
        support both `null` and proper string values.

    - subject: Add “organization” resource
      hash: d0b738203b2b11b686f69c97f3e8382b5ef9fbb9
      body: >
        Organizations sit one level higher than applications and users, and
        scope access to resources. Applications belong to organizations and
        users are members of organizations, which grants users access to those
        applications.


        Because the core API is single-user, organizations offer nothing new
        (the admin user has full access to every resource unconditionally) but
        allow the core and cloud APIs to expose a uniform interface to clients,
        which is the motivation of this change.


        People familiar with the cloud model will observe that I’ve included the
        bare minimum of resources that would let clients:


        - query which organizations exist

        - query which users are members of an organization

        - query which organizations a user is a member of


        You’ll also observe that I’ve not updated user authorization to go
        through org membership. We’d still have to grant all permissions
        unconditionally and it would make things explicit, but the permissions
        would become much more complicated adding both maintenance and
        performance ovehead and we’d still not be able to reuse the permissions
        on the cloud API. I don’t think the tradeoff is worth it and we can

    - subject: 'Prepare the heartbeat interval queries only once, on first use'
      hash: ba773e89a0ef7fcf8527ae0877e4c54472bdb211
      body: |
        It seems that so far these were re-calculated on each
        request. The queries are now prepared lazily, so the
        startup time will not be affected, but had to do this
        anyway since at the point that this loaded api.resin
        was still undefined :)

        The original purpose of the flag is to be able to
        discontinue host applications, but the same concept
        can be used by users to mark applications that are not
        supported/developed anymore. This was discussed at a
        product call and we decided to go with is_archived
        based on Github's terminology as the meaning of both
        are close.

              hash: 263d40d3d2fedc03ab639a94255b8b013f86ab7f
              body: >
                When a permission uses the `canAccess()` function to derive
                access,

                to another resource, we can optimize the generated SQL queries
                to not,

                reapply the full permission for resources, that are reached by

                expanding or filtering paths. We achieve this by, applying
                shortcuts

                in the relationships of the abstract sql model, if we find
                usages of

                an `canAccess()` function in the relevant permissions, that link
                the

                resources in the correct direction.


                An example:


                Let's imagine a model where a `device` belongs to an
                `application`.


                We have the following permissions:


                ```

                example.application.get?belongs_to__user/any(u:u/actor eq
                @__ACTOR_ID)

                example.device.get?belongs_to__application/canAccess()

                ```


                Given the following odata query:

                ```

                GET
                /example/application?$select=id,name&$filter=(owns__device/any(d:d/name
                eq 'test'))&$expand=owns__device($select=id,name)

                ```


                Will not yield the following SQL statement anymore:

                ```

                SELECT (
                        SELECT coalesce(array_to_json(array_agg("application.owns-device".*)), '[]') AS "owns__device"
                        FROM (
                                SELECT "application.owns-device"."id", "application.owns-device"."name"
                                FROM (
                                        SELECT "device"."created at", "device"."id", "device"."belongs to-application", "device"."name"
                                        FROM "device"

                As one can see we don't apply the device access permission

        We currently need the flag to mark host OS releases as invalid
        so they can be filtered out from the list of available releases.
        The future plan is for the supervisor to automatically rollback
        invalidated releases, but there are no dedicated resources to
        work on that just yet.

      body: >
        Back in the open sourcing days, it was thought that open-balena-api
        would completely wrap PineJS and expose higher level abstractions for
        clients, such as the cloud API. For this reason, it re-exported a few
        common PineJS types.


        This is not where we’re going however, so remove those exports, and have
        clients import them from PineJS.

        The supervisor introduced a "jitter" to the supplied poll interval
        value of between 0.5x and 1.5x the configured value. The state mechanims
        will now always account for the 1.5x case, so devices will be considered
        online for the max possible time.

      hash: 738a2816dd86c6bd7787ce3f1ce4e56db6e54534
      body: |
        docker login happens with no scopes provided (unlike docker pull and
        push, where there's always a scope). In this login case, provide
        authentication for an empty scope. This means any username/password
        is allowed for login, but nonetheless this does not weaken access, as
        on pull and push the request will be rechecked whether it can access
        the specific images.

        This allows docker login to work again, that stopped working in
        v0.17.4, that is #85

                Debian Buster now uses Avahi 0.7 instead of
                0.6.32. This means that there is now a stricter
                policy defining MDNS domains. This commit allows
                us to use multipart subdomains.

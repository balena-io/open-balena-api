              body: >
                On empty database schemas the `migrations` model is not
                executed.

                Hence, every model migration that is executed before the `migrations` model

                will not be tracked properly. This is an edge case for empty database schemas.

      body: |
        Enables row narrowing when the rule is
        triggered by application changes, but more
        importantly allows bC to rewrite the rule using
        a GROUP BY.
        Also reduces slightly the full rule runtime from
        ~200ms to ~180ms.

      body: |
        Currently that rule does a full table scan and
        needs 2s, so adding a partial index on the
        deprecated release_version, fields should
        greatly improve its performance, while having
        small DB size & index maintenance work load.

        heartbeat state forever.

      hash: 98c21ac4c2dc42a32ab34669139147b04442f2d0
      body: |
        PR #1199 relaxed the allowed character set for configuration variables,
        but it also inadvertently relaxed the `/config/vars` JSON schema
        exported by the API. This would cause that the UI allows the extended
        character set for env vars, but the API would ultimately reject it,
        creating an inconsistency. This PR adds a `configVarInvalidRegex`
        variable to the schema that should be adopted by the UI to render
        configuration variables.

                        This increases the minimum postgres version for
                        AggregateJSON from 9.2

                        to 9.3 but it is likely that other places already require postgres

                        >=9.3 and as such this should not increase the minimum version at all.

                        If it does somehow manage to then increasing the minimum from a 2012

                        postgres to 2013 should still be fine

    - subject: Disable changing device name via the state endpoint
      hash: 7dd4f5e2a1e528a2e60d6b4707825aec06267325
      body: |
        While the state endpoint allows patching the device name since v2, that
        feature hasn't really been used by supervisor until supervisor v13 when
        that feature was introduced by mistake. Because of a race condition
        between supervisors v13.0.0 and v14.0.2, the device name may get either
        an empty value or the value 'local', this can cause confusion in users
        or affect the user workflows that depend on having distinct device
        names.

        This commit removes the device name from the list of allowed patch
        variables for the v3 state endpoint.

      body: |
        Atm is_host eq 1 or is_public eq 1 ===
        is_public eq 1, so the is_host check is
        redundant. It seem that the is_host eq 1 is a
        leftover since before we added is_public and
        adopted its semantics in host apps.

                        isNumericValue is evaluated in arithmetic expressions

                        if operands in expression can be used as numericValues.


                        In SQL statements arithmetic expressions like add/sub are supported for date values.

                        DateArithmetic nodes need input dependent typing.

                                isNumericValue is evaluated in arithmetic
                                expressions

                                if operands in expression can be used as numericValues.


                                In SQL statements arithmetic expressions like add/sub are supported for date values.

                                DateArithmetic nodes need input dependent typing.

                Give preference to TypeScript over CoffeeScript for the example

                Improve code blocks by giving them types and removing unnecessary

                characters to enable better copy-paste when viewing on GitHub.

    - subject: Prevent unauthenticated requests from proceeding in token auth
      hash: 3e104e34c111f06b9e1bb3de2c64e28678d9c1d9
      body: >
        Authentication failure due to "no credentials provided" and due to
        "invalid credentials provided" are currently treated in exactly the same
        way: we just let the request proceed and rely on (no) permissions to
        limit access to resources. This is problematic (it can result in
        redundant work being done in the API) and misleading ("I've provided
        creds but I get back no results").


        This change separates the latter case and responds immediately with 401, as it should.


        This is however a workaround and ideally it would be Pine that makes this distinction and throws an exception appropriately but this would be a breaking change to existing code.

        Since the date header is automatically added when you set the status

        Supervisor target state requests are usually cached and as such the

        supervisors by a significant percentage

                Modules may need to know if a model existed before
                initialisation of the instance.

                Eg. migrations need to know if a model is freshly generated / executed

                of if this model already existed and can be target for migrations.

                permissions, and also now constrains the model to the specific

                permissions passed in rather than bypassing permissions altogether

                                        Property type describes if the reference
                                        is 'strict' or 'informative'.


                                        Behaviour change only if type is informative otherwise default 'strict'.


                                        An informative reference is just an int field that points

                                        to another tables id field - like foreign key without constraints

                                        or foregein key cascades.

                                Property type describes if the reference is
                                'strict' or 'informative'.


                                Behaviour change only if type is informative otherwise default 'strict'.


                                An informative reference is just an int field that points

                                to another tables id field - like foreign key without constraints

                                or foregein key cascades.

                        Property type describes if the reference is 'strict' or
                        'informative'.


                        Behaviour change only if type is informative otherwise default 'strict'.


                        An informative reference is just an int field that points

                        to another tables id field - like foreign key without constraints

                        or foregein key cascades.

                                        Property type describes if the reference
                                        is 'strict' or 'informative'.


                                        Behaviour change only if type is informative otherwise default 'strict'.


                                        An informative reference is just an int field that points

                                        to another tables id field - like foreign key without constraints

                                        or foregein key cascades.

                                'strict' or 'informative'.


                                Behaviour change only if type is informative otherwise default 'strict'.


                                An informative reference is just an int field that points

                                to another tables id field - like foreign key without constraints

                                or foregein key cascades.

    - subject: Only publish logs to redis subscribers if there are any
      hash: 00393277e4a0b618101e41d61ced675a72c64288
      body: |
        The idea of this is that if we can avoid issuing the PUBLISH calls for
        logs when there are no active subscribers then we can save a lot of
        work for redis, particularly when there are many nodes. The problem is
        that there's no (safe) way to get the number of current subscribers,
        you can query for current subscribers but it'll only return subscribers
        that are connected to the current node and as it is possible to
        subscribe to any node that means that no subscribers on the current
        node is not the same as no subscribers. The solution used here is to
        increment a subscribers count key when a given API instance first
        subscribes to a given device's logs and then decrement it when
        unsubscribing. The problem with that is that if we experience a
        crash/redeploy/etc the subscribers count could end up being permanently
        > 0, we handle that here by adding an expiry time when incrementing the
        subscribers count and using a heartbeat whilst the subscription is
        active to ensure that the subscribers count does not expire whilst we
        have an actively subscribed instance but it will expire if the instance
        that incremented it disappears for whatever reason. This does mean that
        if we get regular connects/disconnects for certain logs then it means
        the subscriber count for that log would never expire but the
        expectation is that should be rare enough that the small extra load
        from that is minimal and still better than having no subscriber count
        mechanism.

        For the intial release we are not supporting applications with multiple
        services as the intended use is blocks.

        These changes will reject requests with a value for service following
        the commit|semver.

        It will also reject images at the DB query if the release has multiple
        release images.

        Revert this commit to restore support for multiple services.

      body: |
        This assumes that all clients that can access
        an image, also have access to the application
        it belongs to. The speed gains for device
        authorizations are b/c of how canAccess()
        permissions are applied & how PG is able to
        run the complex application read permission
        on the top level of the query rather than when
        nested 4 into level of `EXISTS (SELECT 1)`.

        It seems that atm it's not needed & on top of
        that, the "edge" has been discontinued for
        some time now. Other than that and
        returning just the slug, the
        `normalizeDeviceType` was literally the
        same as `findBySlug`.

      body: |
        The cloud API has a rule which enforces this
        restriction, which means that a PATCH of a device's
        supervisor_version could fail if this code returned
        a release of a different public app that has the same
        release_version.

                + allows balenaMachine(s)/BoB(s) to automatically configure

                + auto-configuration requires balena-ca and cert-manager to do the heavy lifting prior

                * refactor confd.service to include both root-ca and host-envvars handling

                * add systemd path watcher to restart confd if keys/certs change during runtime

                * store stack configuration available to all services in a persistent/shared volume (/balena)

                * change resolver order to dns => mdns (ipv4) => mdns (ipv6) => return

                * configure API key and JOSE/JWT key id

                * configure open-balena-vpn (PKI) environment variables

                * configure Sentry DSNs

                * configure API keys/tokens

                * configure proxy and devices SSH keys

                * bundle Git SSH keys

                * refactor environment handling in non-systemd variant

                * deprecate BALENA_ prefixes from confd

        We already enforce this in the hook itself, and this rule prevents
        devices that have provisioned with an invalidated hostapp release from
        ever PATCHing/updating after the fact. we ideally only want to enforce
        this rule at upgrade time, rather than always

        This reverts commit db990479be2611f24b6262e12e1dfa092473cea0.

        OpenBalena is not the place to do the config vars change for the private
        device types such as the UniPi Neuron so we revert this commit here.

        This will reduce the load for the common case where active devices are
        not regularly deleted with the potential to briefly respond with a 401
        when a device is first deleted. There may also be a slight delay for
        restored devices to be able to communicate again however again that is
        a very rare case.

        some devices are missing service installs. It also allows simplifying
        the "should track latest release" implementation as it no longer needs
        to care about creating service installs itself

        This now requires boolean config vars must be `true` or `false`, or
        not set if they're optional, previously we compared against just `true`
        so any other values would be treated as `false` which could be
        confusing in the case of eg `1`/`on`

                Instantiating an `OData2AbstractSQL` instance can be relatively
                costly

                performance improvement

      hash: 9c8ad00d99b239d258dcea7130dba5dee9e60b7b
      body: |
        Currently if the API fails to fetch the device types,
        it would retry infinitely, making the dashboard fail
        to load in BoB if there are no device types in S3, and
        this should resolve that.
